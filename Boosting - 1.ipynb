    "## Advantages of Boosting\n",
    "#### High Predictive Accuracy: \n",
    "- Boosting often outperforms other algorithms on classification and regression tasks. It’s a top pick for Kaggle champions for a reason.\n",
    "#### Handles Bias and Variance: \n",
    "- It reduces both bias (via sequential learning) and variance (through aggregation), leading to a strong generalization.\n",
    "#### No Need for Feature Scaling: \n",
    "- Since it usually uses decision trees as base learners, there's no requirement for normalization or standardization.\n",
    "#### Focus on Difficult Cases: \n",
    "- Boosting directs attention to the examples previous models got wrong, making it particularly useful in imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "#### Versatile: \n",
    "- Works for regression, classification, ranking—and can even handle custom loss functions."

    "## Limitations of Boosting\n",
    "#### Sensitive to Noise and Outliers: \n",
    "- Since it focuses on hard-to-predict cases, it can overfit if the “hard cases” are actually just noise. (For the boosting : ensemblem technique, i must be careful if the data is not just noise and to remove the outliers before training the model)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Can Be Slow: \n",
    "- Because it trains models sequentially, boosting is generally slower than bagging or other parallelizable methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity in Interpretation: \n",
    "- Although some models like XGBoost offer feature importance, the ensemble nature can still be a black box compared to simpler models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuning is Crucial: \n",
    "- Hyperparameters like learning rate, number of estimators, and tree depth need to be carefully tuned—default settings rarely work best."

You show them pictures, and each time they mess up (say, they call a lion a cat), you really emphasize that mistake in the next lesson.
