    "- Handles Multicollinearity: \n",
    "    - Elastic Net can handle situations where predictor variables are highly correlated. It can select groups of correlated features together1.\n",
    "- Feature Selection: \n",
    "    - It performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, which helps in identifying the most important features2.\n",
    "- Flexibility: \n",
    "    - By combining Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) penalties, it provides a more flexible regularization method3.\n",
    "- Prevents Overfitting: \n",
    "    - It helps in preventing overfitting, especially when the number of predictors is larger than the number of observations."

    "- Complexity: \n",
    "    - It is more complex to tune compared to using just Lasso or Ridge regression because it involves two parameters (α and λ) instead of one3.\n",
    "- Computationally Intensive: \n",
    "    - Finding the optimal parameters can be computationally intensive, especially with large datasets2.\n",
    "- Not Always Necessary:\n",
    "    - In some cases, simpler models like Lasso or Ridge might perform just as well without the added complexity of Elastic Net."

    "- Elastic Net uses a combination of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties. The L1 penalty can set some coefficients to zero, while the L2 penalty shrinks the coefficients but keeps them all in the model. The balance between these two penalties is controlled by a parameter called alpha.\n",

    "- The coefficients that are not zero represent the relationship between the predictors and the response variable. A positive coefficient means that as the predictor increases, the response variable also increases. A negative coefficient means the opposite."
