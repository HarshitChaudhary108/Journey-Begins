    "### 1. Data Sparsity\n",
    "#### Why it matters: \n",
    "- As dimensions increase, data points scatter across a vast space.\n",
    "#### Impact: \n",
    "- Models struggle to find meaningful patterns because local neighborhoods become empty, affecting algorithms like KNN, clustering, and density estimation.\n",
    "### 2. Distance Measures Become Unreliable\n",
    "#### Why it matters: \n",
    "- In high dimensions, the contrast between near and far diminishes.\n",
    "#### Impact: \n",
    "- For KNN or SVM, where distance defines classification, predictions can become erratic and less accurate.\n",
    "### 3. Increased Computational Cost\n",
    "#### Why it matters: \n",
    "- More features mean more calculations, especially for algorithms that scale poorly with feature count.\n",
    "#### Impact: \n",
    "- Slower training and testing times, increased memory usage, and risk of inefficiency in real-time systems.\n",
    "### 4. Model Overfitting\n",
    "#### Why it matters: \n",
    "- High dimensions = more opportunities to fit noise.\n",
    "#### Impact: \n",
    "- Models capture spurious patterns that don‚Äôt generalize. Your model looks great on training data but flops on new examples.\n",
    "### 5. Visualization Limitations\n",
    "#### Why it matters: \n",
    "- Humans can't easily interpret data beyond 3D.\n",
    "#### Impact: \n",
    "- Diagnosing issues, spotting outliers, and communicating results becomes harder.\n",
    "### 6. Feature Redundancy & Multicollinearity\n",
    "#### Why it matters: \n",
    "- Some features may be strongly correlated or add no new information.\n",
