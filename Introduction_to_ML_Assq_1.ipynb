    "### Artificial Intelligence \n",
    "#### Definition: Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, and language understanding.\n",
    "#### Example: Imagine a smart vacuum cleaner that can navigate your home, avoid obstacles, and clean efficiently without human intervention. This is an AI application that uses sensors, algorithms, and decision-making capabilities to perform its tasks1.\n",
    "#\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "#### Definition: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML models improve their performance over time by learning from examples.\n",
    "#### Example: Consider a language learning app like Duolingo. It uses machine learning to adapt its lessons based on your progress, adjusting difficulty levels and personalized content to help you learn a new language effectively2.\n",
    "#\n",
    "### Deep Learning\n",
    "#### Definition: Deep Learning is a specialized form of ML that uses deep neural networks with multiple layers (hence “deep”). These networks can automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data, making them powerful for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.\n",
    "#### Example: Image recognition is a classic deep learning application. For instance, when you upload a photo to social media, the platform can automatically identify objects, people, or places in the image using deep learning techniques3..."
