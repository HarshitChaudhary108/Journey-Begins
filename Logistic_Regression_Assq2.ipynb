    "#### The main goal of Grid Search CV is to improve the performance of a machine learning model by finding the best combination of hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are settings that you can adjust to control how the model learns.\n",

    "- Define Hyperparameters: \n",
    "    - You start by listing the hyperparameters you want to test and the possible values for each.\n",
    "- Create a Grid: \n",
    "    - Grid Search CV creates a grid of all possible combinations of these hyperparameters. If you have 3 values for C and 3 values for gamma, you’ll have 9 combinations to test.                                                                                                                                                \n",

    "- How It Works: \n",
    "    - Grid Search CV tests every possible combination of the hyperparameters you specify. Imagine you have a grid of options, and it checks each box one by one.\n",
    "- Pros: \n",
    "    - It guarantees finding the best combination because it tries all possibilities.\n",
    "- Cons: \n",
    "    - It can be very time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially if you have many hyperparameters or a large range of values.\n",
    "#### Randomized Search CV :\n",
    "- How It Works: \n",
    "    - Randomized Search CV randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters to test. Instead of checking every box, it picks a few at random.\n",
    "- Pros: \n",
    "    - It’s faster and less computationally intensive because it doesn’t test every possible combination.\n",
    "- Cons: \n",
    "    - It might miss the best combination since it doesn’t check all possibilities, but it usually finds a good enough solution."

    "#### Randomized Search CV: \n",

    "#### What is Data Leakage?\n",
    "- Data leakage happens when information from outside the training dataset is used to create a machine learning model. This extra information can make the model seem more accurate during training but causes it to perform poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "#### Why is it a Problem?\n",
    "- Data leakage is a problem because it leads to overly optimistic performance estimates during training. When the model is deployed in the real world, it fails to perform as expected, leading to poor decisions and unreliable predictions.\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "    - Imagine you’re building a model to predict whether a customer will default on a loan. Your dataset includes information like the customer’s income, credit score, and whether they defaulted on a previous loan. If you accidentally include the “default” column (which indicates if they defaulted in the past) in your training data, the model will learn to predict defaults based on this information. However, in the real world, you won’t have this “default” column available when making predictions for new customers. As a result, the model will perform well during training but fail in real-world scenarios."
